**Predicting Blood Group from Fingerprint Images for Hospital Blood Bank Management**

HEMOTOUCH is an innovative system that uniquely combines deep learning and hospital management. Its core feature is the ability to predict a person's blood group directly from a fingerprint image using advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This breakthrough enables rapid, non-invasive blood group identification, which can be especially valuable in emergency situations or for populations without prior blood group records.

The predicted blood group is seamlessly integrated into a hospital blood bank management system. This allows for:

- **Instant Blood Group Detection:** Upload a fingerprint image and instantly receive a blood group prediction.
- **Efficient Blood Requests:** Patients or staff can request blood based on fingerprint identification, streamlining the process and reducing errors.
- **Donor Registration:** Donors can register quickly by verifying their blood group through fingerprint, ensuring accurate records.
- **Inventory Management:** The system tracks blood group quantities, compatible blood types, and manages donor information, helping hospitals maintain optimal blood supplies.

By combining biometric identification with blood bank logistics, HEMOTOUCH offers a unique, practical solution for modern healthcare facilities, improving both speed and reliability in blood transfusion services.
